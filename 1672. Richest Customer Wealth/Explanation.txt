I created a empty list as a way to store the total amount of money each person has in order to compare whats the highest amount of money stored in the bank. I employed the use of nested for loops in order to extract the customer's bank account then the moeny in each account. I then add the money in each account to the "amount" variable. This will help me get the total amount of money each customer has and then store it in the "total" list. I then returned only the max values in the total list.
